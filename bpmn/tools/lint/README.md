Install bpmnlint utility

````

## Rules

In default configuration some basic rules are applied.
You can change default behaviour by modifying the `.bpmnlintrc`  

E.g. to disable the rule checking empty lables add `rule` tag as follows

````
{
  "extends": "bpmnlint:recommended",
  "rules": {
    "label-required": "off"
  }
}
````
